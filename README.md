# CimpleOs

CimpleOs — a small, educational, and opinionated hobby operating system written to teach OS concepts clearly and simply.

> "Cimple" = "C (and) Simple" — a compact OS that demonstrates core operating system ideas with a small, readable codebase.

## Status
- Early development / proof of concept.
- Core goals: booting, basic kernel facilities, simple multitasking, and a minimal driver set.
- Not production-ready. Intended for learning, experimentation, and contributions.

## Goals
- Keep sources small, approachable, and well-documented.
- Teach basics: boot process, memory management, interrupts, context switching, and simple filesystem ideas.
- Provide a reproducible toolchain and emulation layers (QEMU) for easy experimentation.
- Be modular so features (drivers, filesystems, userspace) can be developed independently.

## Features (planned / implemented)
- Bootloader (multiboot / multiboot2 or simple stage-2 loader)
- x86_64 kernel (C + minimal assembly)
- Basic VGA text output + serial console
- Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and basic IRQ handling
- Physical & virtual memory management (paging)
- Simple scheduler (cooperative / preemptive)
- Basic heap allocator / kmalloc
- Simple init process and a tiny userspace demo (optional)
- Run inside QEMU or on real hardware (advanced)

## Repository layout (example)
- /boot — bootloader code and stage images
- /kernel — kernel C and assembly sources
- /arch — architecture-specific helpers (x86_64)
- /drivers — device drivers (VGA, serial, timer)
- /user — tiny userspace programs (optional)
- /scripts — build and test helper scripts
- /docs — design notes, RFCs, and developer guides

Adjust paths to match this repository if different.

## Requirements
- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- Installed build tools: make, gcc/clang (host compiler), nasm/yasm, grub tools (optional), pkg-config
- Cross-compiler for target architecture (recommended) — e.g., x86_64-elf-gcc
- QEMU for emulation/testing

Tip: Use a Docker container or a distro-provided cross-toolchain package to avoid contaminating your host toolchain.

## Quick start — build & run (example)
Note: adapt toolchain and commands to the repository's build system (Makefile, CMake, etc).

1. Configure/prepare the toolchain (example using x86_64-elf):
   - Install x86_64-elf-gcc and binutils, or build a cross-toolchain.
2. Build:
   - make all
   - or: ./scripts/build.sh
3. Run in QEMU:
   - make run
   - or: qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=os_image.bin -serial stdio -monitor none -m 512M

Example (when using a typical Makefile):
```
make TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=x86_64-elf- all
make TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=x86_64-elf- run
```

If this repo uses CMake, follow:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-x86_64-elf.cmake
cmake --build .
./run-qemu.sh
```

## Development notes
- Keep design documents in /docs. Before adding major features, write a short RFC in docs/ so maintainers and contributors can discuss trade-offs.
- Favor clarity over cleverness. Comment unusual code paths and assembly thoroughly.
- Tests: where possible, add small automated tests for helpers (linker scripts, formatters) and run kernel smoke tests under QEMU.

## Common commands
- make clean — remove build artifacts
- make dist — create disk image / OS image
- make qemu — start QEMU with sane defaults
- run-tests.sh — run any available test-suite or qemu smoke tests

(Replace with repository-specific targets if they differ.)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome — issues, PRs, and design proposals.

Suggested workflow:
- Open an issue describing the problem/feature.
- Start a branch: git checkout -b feat/short-description
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Include tests or a manual test plan for kernel changes.
- Reference the issue in your PR and provide instructions to reproduce.

Code style:
- Prefer simple, well-documented C (or the language used).
- Limit use of complex macros; prefer explicit helper functions.
- Keep assembly isolated in arch/ or kernel/ with clear comments.

## Roadmap
Short-term:
- Solidify build system and reproducible images.
- Implement paging + basic allocator improvements.
- Add documented examples in /user.

Mid-term:
- Simple filesystem support (in-memory / ramdisk).
- Expand driver coverage (keyboard, disk).
- Better testing and CI (QEMU-based tests).

Long-term:
- Experiment with simple userspace, process isolation, and more advanced schedulers.

## Troubleshooting
- If QEMU hangs early: check your bootloader/linker script and kernel entry point; enable serial output for early logs.
- If the cross-compiler is not found: install x86_64-elf-gcc or update TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX in the Makefile.
- Use verbose build flags to inspect commands (e.g., make V=1).

## Security and Safety
This is a learning project. Do not use this OS for production or to store sensitive data. Running experimental OS code in QEMU or isolated hardware is advised.

## License
Pick a license that fits your goals (permissive vs copyleft). Examples:
- MIT / Expat — permissive, minimal restrictions
- BSD-2 / BSD-3 — permissive
- GPLv3 — copyleft, share-alike

(If you already have a license file, state it here.)

If you want, I can:
- Customize this README to match your repository structure and exact build commands,
- Add badges (build / CI / license) and a short getting-started script,
- Produce a CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md pair.

Tell me which of the above you'd like next and provide any repo-specific details (build system, toolchain prefix, supported architectures).
